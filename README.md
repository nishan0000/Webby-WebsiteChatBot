## Webby: Chatbot for Website Interaction with Streamlit GUI
Welcome to the GitHub repository for Webby, a chatbot designed for interacting with websites through a Streamlit GUI. Webby integrates LangChain technology to extract information from various websites and provide user-friendly responses.

### Key Features
- Website Interaction: Webby leverages LangChain to interact with websites and extract relevant information.
- Advanced Language Models: Compatibility with various language models such as GPT-4, Mistral, Llama2, and ollama.
- Intuitive Streamlit GUI: The user interface is built with Streamlit, ensuring an easy and accessible experience for users.
- Python-based: Entirely coded in Python for flexibility and ease of use.
- Entirely langchain bassed development. Easy integration of multiple new features possible.
- Webby utilizes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. This involves augmenting the knowledge of the language model with additional information passed in the prompt. Text is vectorized to find -the most similar content to the prompt, which is then passed to the language model as a prefix.
